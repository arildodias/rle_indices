# Ecosystem indices to support global biodiversity conservation

Example code for Rowland JA, Bland LM, Keith DA, Juffe‐Bignoli D, Burgman MA, Etter A, Ferrer‐Paris JR, Miller RM, Skowno AL, Nicholson E. 2020. Ecosystem indices to support global biodiversity conservation. Conservation Letters 13:311. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.12680

The code here includes method to calculate the three ecosystem indices presented in Rowland et al. (2020).

## Red List of Index of Ecosystems
#### Index overview
The Red List Index of ecosystems (RLIE) measures trends in ecosystem collapse risk. It uses the risk categories defined based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessments. The index complements the Red List Index of species survival, providing comparable information about ecosystems risk. It is calculated for the overall risk category assigned to each ecosystem and separately for each criterion.

## Ecosystem Area Index
#### Index overview
The Ecosystem Area Index (EAI) measures trends measures trends in changes in ecosystem area towards ecosystem collapse. The EAI is the geometric mean of the proportion of ecosystem area remaining over a given timeframe relative to the initial area and an ecosystem-specific collapse threshold. It uses data on ecosystem area and aea-based collapse threshold as defined based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessments.

## Ecosystem Health Index
